# 42_philosophers
This is a project from the fourth circle of the 42 Common Core. Its goal is to teach concurrent programming, making use of multithreading and multiprocessing.

The project involves creating a simulation of the "Dining Philosophers" problem, illustrating synchronization issues and the ways to resolve them with mutex and semaphores.
